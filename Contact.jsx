                <p>For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll be writing our JavaScript code in this script tag. We don't
                    have any advanced live-reloading so you'll need to refresh your browser to see updates after saving.
                    Follow your progress by opening <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser (after starting
                    the server). When you load this for the first time without any changes, you'll see the finished
                    product of what we're going to build. When you're ready to start working, just delete the preceding
                    <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and then you can continue.</p>
